# Symbolic Programming System & Zero-less ALU
_A novel symbolic computing system by Clarke Ball_

## ðŸ§  Overview
This project introduces a zero-less symbolic number system paired with a symbolic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing operations like ADD, SUB, NOT, AND, OR, XOR â€” all without relying on traditional base-10 arithmetic or the digit 0. The system leverages mirrored symbolic digits and macro folding to enable compression, logic compilation, and highly structured computation.

## ðŸ”¢ Key Concepts
- **Zero-less symbolic number system** with mirrored digit sets
- **Symbolic macro compression** for program size reduction
- **Symbolic constants** for Ï€, âˆš2, and Ï† using finite representations
- **Cycle-aware ALU** for measuring computational depth
- **Real-world modeling** using symbolic programs (e.g., Fibonacci, primes)

## ðŸ“¦ Modules Included
- `symbolic_encoder`: Converts symbolic numbers to mirrored binary
- `symbolic_ALU`: Executes core symbolic operations
- `macro_library`: Finite definitions of constants like MACRO_PI, MACRO_SQRT2, MACRO_PHI
- `unit_tests`: Test suite for validating symbolic programs and encodings
- `real_world_examples`: Sample programs for benchmarking and demonstration

## ðŸ”¬ Philosophical Position
This work proposes an improvement over traditional calculus and number theory by resolving inconsistencies introduced by irrational numbers and zero-based sets. It serves as a foundational shift in how logic, number representation, and computation can be structured.
